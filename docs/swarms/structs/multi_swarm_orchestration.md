# Hierarchical Agent Orchestration Architectures

Hierarchical agent orchestration involves organizing multiple agents in structured layers to efficiently handle complex tasks. There are several key architectures available, each with distinct characteristics and use cases.

Here are the Hierarchical swarms we support:

| Architecture | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| HHCS | - Clear task routing<br>- Specialized swarm handling<br>- Parallel processing capability<br>- Good for complex multi-domain tasks | - More complex setup<br>- Overhead in routing<br>- Requires careful swarm design |
| Auto Agent Builder | - Dynamic agent creation<br>- Flexible scaling<br>- Self-organizing<br>- Good for evolving tasks | - Higher resource usage<br>- Potential creation overhead<br>- May create redundant agents |
| SwarmRouter | - Multiple workflow types<br>- Simple configuration<br>- Flexible deployment<br>- Good for varied task types | - Less specialized than HHCS<br>- Limited inter-swarm communication<br>- May require manual type selection |



## Core Architectures

### 1. Hybrid Hierarchical-Cluster Swarm (HHCS)

Hybrid Hierarchical-Cluster Swarm (HHCS) is architecture that uses a Router Agent to analyze and distribute tasks to other swarms.

- Tasks are routed to specialized swarms based on their requirements

- Enables parallel processing through multiple specialized swarms

- Ideal for complex, multi-domain tasks and enterprise-scale operations

- Provides clear task routing but requires more complex setup

    SwarmN -->|Process| ResultN[Output N]
    
    Result1 --> Final[Final Output]
    Result2 --> Final
    ResultN --> Final
```

### 2. Auto Agent Builder

Auto Agent Builder is a dynamic agent architecture that creates specialized agents on-demand.

- Analyzes tasks and automatically builds appropriate agents for the job

- Maintains an agent pool that feeds into task orchestration

- Best suited for evolving requirements and dynamic workloads

- Self-organizing but may have higher resource usage

    Pool --> Agent1[Specialized Agent 1]
    Pool --> Agent2[Specialized Agent 2]
    Pool --> AgentN[Specialized Agent N]
    
    Agent1 --> Orchestration[Task Orchestration]
    Agent2 --> Orchestration
    AgentN --> Orchestration
    
    Orchestration --> Result[Final Result]
```

### 3. SwarmRouter


SwarmRouter is a flexible system supporting multiple swarm architectures through a simple interface:

- Sequential workflows

- Concurrent workflows

- Hierarchical swarms

- Group chat interactions

- Simpler to configure and deploy compared to other architectures

- Best for general-purpose tasks and smaller scale operations

- Recommended for 5-20 agents.

```
