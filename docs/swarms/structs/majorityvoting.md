# MajorityVoting Module Documentation

The `MajorityVoting` module provides a sophisticated multi-loop consensus building system for agents. Unlike simple majority voting, this system enables iterative consensus building where agents can refine their responses across multiple loops, with each subsequent loop considering the previous consensus. This approach leads to more robust and well-reasoned final decisions by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple specialized agents.

### Key Concepts


- **Multi-Loop Consensus Building**: An iterative process where agents can refine their responses across multiple loops, with each loop building upon the previous consensus.

- **Agents**: Specialized entities (e.g., models, algorithms) that provide expert responses to tasks or queries.

- **Consensus Agent**: An automatically created agent that analyzes and synthesizes responses from all agents to determine the final consensus.

- **Conversation History**: A comprehensive record of all agent interactions, responses, and consensus building across all loops.

- **Output Types**: Support for different output formats (string, dictionary, list) with flexible formatting options.

- **Concurrent Execution**: Agents run simultaneously for improved performance and efficiency.

# Create specialized agents
agents = [
    Agent(agent_name="Analyst-1", system_prompt="You are a market analyst..."),
    Agent(agent_name="Analyst-2", system_prompt="You are a risk specialist..."),
    Agent(agent_name="Analyst-3", system_prompt="You are a portfolio manager...")
]

# Initialize majority voting system
swarm = MajorityVoting(
    name="Investment-Swarm",
    agents=agents,
    max_loops=2,
    output_type="dict"
)

# Execute single task
result = swarm.run(
    "Analyze the current market conditions and provide investment recommendations for a $50k portfolio"
)

print(f"Consensus Result: {result}")
```

**Example:**
```python
# Define multiple analysis tasks
analysis_tasks = [
    "Analyze the technology sector for growth opportunities",
    "Evaluate the healthcare sector for defensive investments", 
    "Assess the energy sector for value opportunities",
    "Review the financial sector for dividend plays"
]

# Execute batch processing
results = swarm.batch_run(analysis_tasks)

# Process results
for i, (task, result) in enumerate(zip(analysis_tasks, results)):
    print(f"Task {i+1}: {task}")
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

**Performance Considerations:**

- Tasks are processed sequentially, not concurrently

- Each task maintains its own conversation history

- Memory usage scales with the number of tasks and conversation length

---

#### `run_concurrently(tasks: List[str], *args, **kwargs) -> List[Any]`

Executes the majority voting system for multiple tasks concurrently using thread pooling for improved performance.

**Signature:**
```python
def run_concurrently(self, tasks: List[str], *args, **kwargs) -> List[Any]
```

**Parameters:**

- `tasks` (`List[str]`): List of tasks or questions to be processed

- `*args` (`Any`): Variable length argument list passed to each task execution

- `**kwargs` (`Any`): Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to each task execution

**Returns:**

- `List[Any]`: List of consensus results in completion order (not input order)

**Process Flow:**

1. **Thread Pool Creation**: Creates a thread pool with `os.cpu_count()` workers

2. **Concurrent Submission**: Submits all tasks to the thread pool simultaneously

3. **Parallel Execution**: Each task runs independently in its own thread

4. **Result Collection**: Collects results as they complete (not in input order)

**Example:**
```python
# Define multiple research questions
research_questions = [
    "What are the environmental impacts of electric vehicles?",
    "How does AI affect job markets?",
    "What are the economic implications of renewable energy?",
    "How will blockchain technology transform finance?"
]

# Execute concurrent processing
concurrent_results = swarm.run_concurrently(research_questions)

# Results are in completion order, not input order
print(f"Processed {len(concurrent_results)} research questions concurrently")
for i, result in enumerate(concurrent_results):
    print(f"Result {i+1}: {str(result)[:200]}...")
```

**Performance Benefits:**

- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks run simultaneously

- **Optimal Resource Usage**: Uses all available CPU cores

- **Reduced Total Time**: Significantly faster than sequential processing for multiple tasks

**Important Notes:**

- Results are returned in completion order, not input order

- Each task maintains independent conversation history

- Thread safety is handled automatically by the implementation

---

### Configuration Methods

#### `reliability_check() -> None`

Performs validation checks on the majority voting system configuration.

**Signature:**
```python
def reliability_check(self) -> None
```

**Process:**
1. **Agent Validation**: Ensures the agents list is not empty
2. **System Logging**: Logs initialization information with agent details
3. **Error Handling**: Raises `ValueError` if validation fails

**Raises:**

- `ValueError`: If agents list is empty or None

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the majority voting system |
| `name` | `str` | Human-readable name of the system |
| `description` | `str` | Detailed description of the system's purpose |

## Consensus Agent

The MajorityVoting system automatically creates a specialized consensus agent that analyzes and synthesizes responses from all participating agents. This consensus agent uses a sophisticated prompt that:

1. **Comprehensively evaluates** each agent's response across multiple dimensions:
   - Accuracy and correctness
   - Depth of analysis and insight
   - Relevance to the original task
   - Clarity, structure, and communication quality
   - Unique perspectives or innovative ideas

2. **Performs comparative analysis** by:
   - Identifying overlapping themes and points of agreement
   - Highlighting divergent viewpoints or conflicting recommendations
   - Assessing strengths and weaknesses of each approach

3. **Builds consensus** by:
   - Identifying the most effective response(s) with clear justification
   - Synthesizing the best elements from multiple responses when appropriate
   - Providing ranked recommendations with detailed rationales

4. **Delivers actionable results** that are:
   - Fair and balanced
   - Evidence-based and rigorous
   - Well-supported and clearly communicated

The consensus agent can be customized through the constructor parameters:


- `consensus_agent_prompt`: Custom system prompt for the consensus agent

- `consensus_agent_name`: Name for the consensus agent

- `consensus_agent_description`: Description for the consensus agent

- `consensus_agent_model_name`: Model to use for the consensus agent

- `additional_consensus_agent_kwargs`: Additional configuration options

## Usage Patterns

### Single Task Analysis
For focused analysis on a single complex question or task:

```python
# Simple single task execution
result = swarm.run("What are the key risks in the current market?")

# With custom parameters
result = swarm.run(
    "Analyze this investment opportunity", 
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1000
)
```

### Batch Processing
For processing multiple related tasks sequentially:

```python
# Process multiple sectors
sectors = ["Technology", "Healthcare", "Energy", "Finance"]
tasks = [f"Analyze {sector} sector opportunities" for sector in sectors]
results = swarm.batch_run(tasks)
```

### Concurrent Processing
For maximum performance when processing multiple independent tasks:

```python
# Process multiple research questions concurrently
questions = [
    "What are the environmental impacts of AI?",
    "How will quantum computing affect cryptography?",
    "What are the economic implications of space exploration?"
]
results = swarm.run_concurrently(questions)
```
