## Boss System Prompt

The AutoSwarmBuilder uses a comprehensive `BOSS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` that embodies sophisticated multi-agent architecture design principles. This system prompt guides the boss agent in creating highly effective agent teams.

### Core Design Principles

The boss system prompt includes six fundamental design principles:

1. **Comprehensive Task Analysis**
   - Thoroughly deconstruct tasks into fundamental components and sub-tasks
   - Identify specific skills, knowledge domains, and personality traits required
   - Analyze challenges, dependencies, and coordination requirements
   - Map optimal workflows, information flow patterns, and decision-making hierarchies

2. **Agent Design Excellence**
   - Create agents with crystal-clear, specific purposes and domain expertise
   - Design distinct, complementary personalities that enhance team dynamics
   - Ensure agents are self-aware of limitations and know when to seek assistance
   - Create agents that effectively communicate progress, challenges, and insights

3. **Comprehensive Agent Framework**
   - **Role & Purpose**: Precise description of responsibilities and authority
   - **Personality Profile**: Distinct characteristics influencing thinking patterns
   - **Expertise Matrix**: Specific knowledge domains, skill sets, and capabilities
   - **Communication Protocol**: How agents present information and interact
   - **Decision-Making Framework**: Systematic approach to problem-solving
   - **Limitations & Boundaries**: Clear constraints and operational boundaries
   - **Collaboration Strategy**: How agents work together and share knowledge

4. **Advanced System Prompt Engineering**
   - Detailed role and purpose explanations with context and scope
   - Rich personality descriptions with behavioral guidelines
   - Comprehensive capabilities, tools, and resource specifications
   - Detailed communication protocols and reporting requirements
   - Systematic problem-solving approaches with decision-making frameworks
   - Collaboration guidelines and conflict resolution procedures
   - Quality standards, success criteria, and performance metrics
   - Error handling, recovery procedures, and escalation protocols

5. **Multi-Agent Coordination Architecture**
   - Design robust communication channels and protocols between agents
   - Establish clear task handoff procedures and information sharing mechanisms
   - Create feedback loops for continuous improvement and adaptation
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
   - Define escalation paths for complex issues and decision-making hierarchies

6. **Quality Assurance & Governance**
   - Set measurable success criteria for each agent and the overall system
   - Implement verification steps, validation procedures, and quality checks
   - Create mechanisms for self-assessment, peer review, and continuous improvement
   - Establish protocols for handling edge cases and unexpected situations
   - Design governance structures for oversight, accountability, and performance management

### Output Requirements

The boss system prompt ensures that when creating multi-agent systems, the following are provided:

1. **Agent Specifications**: Comprehensive role statements, personality profiles, capabilities, limitations, communication styles, and collaboration strategies
2. **System Prompts**: Complete, detailed prompts embodying each agent's identity and capabilities
3. **Architecture Design**: Team structure, communication flow patterns, task distribution strategies, quality control measures, and error handling procedures
