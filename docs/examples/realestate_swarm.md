# Real Estate Swarm

The Real Estate Swarm is a multi-agent system designed to automate and streamline the entire real estate transaction workflow. From lead generation to property maintenance, this swarm orchestrates a series of specialized AI agents to handle various aspects of buying, selling, and managing properties.

## What it Does

The `RealEstateSwarm` operates as a **sequential workflow**, where each agent's output feeds into the next, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive process. The swarm consists of the following agents:

1.  **Lead Generation Agent (Alex)**: Identifies and qualifies potential real estate clients by gathering their property requirements, budget, preferred locations, and investment goals. This agent also uses the `exa_search` tool for initial lead information.
2.  **Property Research Agent (Emma)**: Conducts in-depth research on properties matching client criteria and market trends. It leverages the `exa_search` tool to gather up-to-date information on local market trends, property values, investment potential, and neighborhood insights.
3.  **Marketing Agent (Jack)**: Develops and executes marketing strategies to promote properties. This includes creating compelling listings, implementing digital marketing campaigns, and managing client interactions.
4.  **Transaction Management Agent (Sophia)**: Handles all documentation, legal, and financial aspects of property transactions, ensuring compliance and smooth closing processes.
5.  **Property Maintenance Agent (Michael)**: Manages property condition, oversees maintenance and repairs, and prepares properties for sale or rental, including staging and enhancing curb appeal.

## How to Set Up

To set up and run the Real Estate Swarm, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement           |
|-----------------------|
| Python 3.8 or higher  |
| pip package manager   |

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use the following command to download all dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Install Swarms framework
    pip install swarms

    # Install environment and logging dependencies
    pip install python-dotenv loguru

    # Install HTTP client and tools
    pip install httpx swarms_tools
    ```
2.  **Set up API Keys:**
    The `Property Research Agent` utilizes the `exa_search` tool, which requires an `EXA_API_KEY`.
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (or wherever your application loads environment variables) and add your API keys:
    ```
    EXA_API_KEY="YOUR_EXA_API_KEY"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_EXA_API_KEY"` & `"OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API keys.

## Step 2: Running the Real Estate Swarm

```python

from typing import List

from swarms.structs.agent import Agent
from swarms.structs.conversation import Conversation
from swarms.utils.history_output_formatter import history_output_formatter

# --- Exa Search Tool Integration ---
# Import and define exa_search as a callable tool for property research.
from swarms_tools import exa_search
