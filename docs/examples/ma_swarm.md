# Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) Advisory Swarm

The M&A Advisory Swarm is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to automate and streamline the entire mergers & acquisitions advisory workflow. By orchestrating a series of specialized AI agents, this swarm provides comprehensive analysis from initial intake to final recommendation.

## What it Does
The `MAAdvisorySwarm` operates as a **sequential workflow**, where each agent's output builds upon previous analyses, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive advisory process. The swarm consists of the following agents:

| Agent Name | Agent (Name) | Key Responsibilities |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Intake & Scoping | Emma | Gathers essential information about the potential deal, including deal type, industry, target profile, objectives, timeline, budget, and specific concerns. It generates an initial Deal Brief. |
| Market & Strategic Analysis | Marcus | Evaluates industry dynamics, competitive landscape, and strategic fit. It leverages the `exa_search` tool to gather real-time market intelligence on trends, key players, and external factors. |
| Financial Valuation & Risk Assessment | Sophia | Performs comprehensive financial health analysis, various valuation methodologies (comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF), synergy assessment, and a detailed risk assessment (financial, operational, legal, market). |
| Deal Structuring | David | Recommends the optimal transaction structure, considering asset vs. stock purchase, cash vs. stock consideration, earnouts, financing strategies, tax optimization, and deal protection mechanisms. |
| Integration Planning | Nathan | Develops a comprehensive post-merger integration roadmap, including Day 1 priorities, a 100-day plan, functional integration strategies (operations, systems, sales, HR), and synergy realization timelines. |
| Final Recommendation | Alex | Synthesizes all prior agent analyses into a comprehensive, executive-ready M&A Advisory Report, including an executive summary, investment thesis, key risks, deal structure, integration approach, and a clear GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL recommendation. |

## How to Set Up

To set up and run the M&A Advisory Swarm, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement           |
|-----------------------|
| Python 3.8 or higher  |
| pip package manager   |

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use the following command to download all dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Install Swarms framework
    pip install swarms

    # Install environment and logging dependencies
    pip install python-dotenv loguru

    # Install HTTP client and tools
    pip install httpx swarms_tools
    ```
2.  **Set up API Keys:**
    The `Property Research Agent` utilizes the `exa_search` tool, which requires an `EXA_API_KEY`.
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (or wherever your application loads environment variables) and add your API keys:
    ```
    EXA_API_KEY="YOUR_EXA_API_KEY"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_EXA_API_KEY"` & `"OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API keys.

## Step 2: Running the Mergers & Acquisitions Advisory Swarm

```python
from typing import List
from loguru import logger
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent
from swarms.structs.conversation import Conversation
from swarms.utils.history_output_formatter import history_output_formatter
from swarms_tools import exa_search
